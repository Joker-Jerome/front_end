CSS Comments
You saw a CSS comment in the code from your previous quiz:

p {
    color: blue;
}        
/* add CSS here */
h1 {
    color: red;
}
The line /* add CSS here */ is a comment. CSS comments are surrounded by an opening /* and a closing */. You must use both. The comment made it clear to you where you needed to add your code and it did not affect the style of the page in any way.

HTML Comments
You can write comments in HTML too! Here's how they look.

<!-- This is a comment -->
<div class="example">Words, words, words.</div>
You must surround your HTML comments with a starting <!-- and a closing -->.
